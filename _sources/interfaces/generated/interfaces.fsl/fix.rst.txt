TrainingSetCreator
------------------

`Link to code <http://github.com/nipy/nipype/tree/93c475b/nipype/interfaces/fsl/fix.py#L84>`__

Goes through set of provided melodic output directories, to find all
the ones that have a hand_labels_noise.txt file in them.

This is outsourced as a separate class, so that the pipeline is
rerun everytime a handlabeled file has been changed, or a new one
created.

        [Mandatory]

        [Optional]
        mel_icas_in: (a list of items which are an existing directory name)
                Melodic output directories

Outputs::

        mel_icas_out: (a list of items which are an existing directory name)
                Hand labels for noise vs signal
