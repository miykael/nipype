Inputs::

        [Mandatory]

        [Optional]
        args: (a unicode string)
                Additional parameters to the command
                flag: %s
        environ: (a dictionary with keys which are a bytes or None or a value
                 of class 'str' and with values which are a bytes or None or a value
                 of class 'str', nipype default value: {})
                Environment variables
        inputVolume: (an existing file name)
                Image To Scale
                flag: --inputVolume %s
        outputVolume: (a boolean or a file name)
                Resulting scaled image
                flag: --outputVolume %s
        pixelType: ('float' or 'short' or 'ushort' or 'int' or 'uint' or
                 'uchar' or 'binary')
                Specifies the pixel type for the input/output images. The 'binary'
                pixel type uses a modified algorithm whereby the image is read in as
                unsigned char, a signed distance map is created, signed distance map
                is resampled, and then a thresholded image of type unsigned char is
                written to disk.
                flag: --pixelType %s
        scaleFactor: (a float)
                The scale factor for the image spacing.
                flag: --scaleFactor %f

Outputs::

        outputVolume: (an existing file name)
                Resulting scaled image
