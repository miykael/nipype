.. index:: CFFConverter

CFFConverter
------------

`Link to code <http://github.com/nipy/nipype/tree/93c475b/nipype/interfaces/cmtk/convert.py#L62>`__

Creates a Connectome File Format (CFF) file from input networks, surfaces, volumes, tracts, etcetera....

Example
~~~~~~~

>>> import nipype.interfaces.cmtk as cmtk
>>> cvt = cmtk.CFFConverter()
>>> cvt.inputs.title = 'subject 1'
>>> cvt.inputs.gifti_surfaces = ['lh.pial_converted.gii', 'rh.pial_converted.gii']
>>> cvt.inputs.tract_files = ['streamlines.trk']
>>> cvt.inputs.gpickled_networks = ['network0.gpickle']
>>> cvt.run()                 # doctest: +SKIP
